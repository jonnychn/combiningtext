# combiningtext
Extract all values from all rows and combine them into a single text file. In summary, this code provides a simple tool for users to convert CSV files into plain text files, where each row of the CSV becomes a single line of text in the output file. The user can then download this processed text file.


#Use Cases
1. Have a single text file (just content, no other parameters like timestamps, content format)
2. Upload it to your desired LLM model to fine tune the data
3. Create your own private knowledge management system
